        <h1>C Language</h1>
        <p>C is a general-purpose programming language known for its efficiency, portability, and flexibility. It was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s as an improvement over the B language, with better data handling and control structures. C played a crucial role in rewriting the UNIX operating system, making it more portable and widely adopted. Over the years, it has been standardized and improved, influencing modern languages like C++, Java, and Python. Today, C remains essential in system programming, embedded systems, and software development due to its speed and reliability.</p>

        <h1>Python</h1>
        <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the late 1980s and officially released in 1991. Designed to emphasize code readability and ease of use, Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Over the years, it has evolved with improvements in performance and functionality, becoming one of the most widely used languages in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and software development. Its extensive libraries and active community make Python a powerful and versatile tool for beginners and professionals alike.</p>

        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s as a way to organize and link documents on the internet. HTML uses a system of elements, or tags, to define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other content on a webpage. Over time, it has evolved with new versions like HTML5, which introduced improved multimedia support and better semantic structure. As the backbone of web development, HTML works alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, making it essential for building modern websites and applications.</p>

        <h1>PHP</h1>
        <p>PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed for web development. It was created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994 as a simple tool for managing his personal website but later evolved into a powerful programming language. PHP is widely used for building dynamic and interactive websites, handling forms, managing databases, and creating web applications. It integrates seamlessly with HTML and works well with databases like MySQL. Over the years, PHP has undergone significant improvements, with modern versions offering better security, performance, and support for object-oriented programming. Despite the rise of newer technologies, PHP remains a key tool in web development, powering popular platforms like WordPress and Facebook.</p>

        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to create dynamic and interactive web content. It was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 while working at Netscape to add interactivity to websites. Unlike HTML and CSS, which handle structure and design, JavaScript enables features like animations, form validation, and real-time updates. It runs directly in web browsers, making it essential for front-end development, while frameworks like Node.js allow it to be used on the server side as well. Over time, JavaScript has evolved with powerful libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, making it one of the most widely used languages in modern web development.</p>
